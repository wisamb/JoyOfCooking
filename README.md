# JoyOfCooking

The book Joy of Cooking is one of the most popular books in the United States. It has provided recipes for many American-favorite dishes since 1936. Each edition, eight in total, has seen recipes come and go, yet some recipes appear in each of the eight editions with minor changes, if any at all.

However, controversy brewed when in 2009, Brian Wansink of Cornell University published “The Joy of Cooking Too Much: 70 Years of Calorie Increases in Classic Recipes”. In this publication, the authors conclude that “calorie density and serving sizes in recipes from The Joy of Cooking have increased since 1936”. In 2018, this paper was retracted when an investigation found that academic misconduct had taken place.

Problem Introduction

This was school project that was composed of two components. For the first part, each student was tasked with creating data tables for two assigned recipes from the book Joy of Cooking, each appearing in 1936 and 2006 (a total of four data files for each student). Each student was then to work on their own to create a single data table from the individual recipe tables.

The second part compares methods of calculating calories and includes a subset of the Wansink data to determine if any bias exist. Method 1 calculates calories using the 4-4-9 method which used factors of 4 for calories from carbohydrates (CHO), 4 for calories from proteins (PRO), and 9 for calories from fat (FAT)2. Method 2 uses the Atwater factors from the USDA database, which are known to be more accurate.
